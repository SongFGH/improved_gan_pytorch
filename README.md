# improved_gan_pytorch
Pytorch implementation of DCGAN based on "Improved Techniques for Training GANs"

Feature matching and semi-supervised GAN have be reimplemented.

Pytorch Version: 2.0.3

In my example, our classifer is for CIFAR10 dataset.

And labeled input: unlabeled input : generated fake input = 1 : 1 : 1

Users can change the setting according to my program's comment.
